Was gonna be LaTeX but HTML is easier to work with

## Places I stole code from
 - http://www.diyplanner.com/node/6270 (inspo)

## How to use
 - Modify fields in `main.js` variable `args`. The year and secondary color are
configurable.
 - To test, run `npm start` and navigate to `localhost:8080` in a browser. For
page-spread view, ensure browser window is wide enough for two pages.
 - To publish, run `npm print`
