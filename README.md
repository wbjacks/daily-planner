Was gonna be LaTeX but HTML is easier to work with

## Places I stole code from
 - http://www.diyplanner.com/node/6270 (inspo)

## How to use
 - Modify fields in `main.js` variable `args`. The year and secondary color are
configurable.
 - To test, run `npm start` and navigate to `localhost:8080` in a browser. For
page-spread view, ensure browser window is wide enough for two pages.
- To print, open the print dialog in chrome and save to PDF. Note that there's an 
in-progress auto-printer, but I couldn't get it working and printing through chrome
works fine.
- I use [Lulu xpress](https://xpress.lulu.com) to print the pdf to a book, but whatever
publishing platform you prefer should work.
